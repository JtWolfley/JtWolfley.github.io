        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>By retirement, I want to be able to reflect on everything I’ve done in my life and be
        content with the outcome, whether it is professional or personal. I want to excel in whatever job I
        end up pursuing, but what I care most about is exploring the different cultures and places within
        the short time I have on this floating rock. At my funeral, I want people to say that I lived my life
        to the fullest and that I took care of and loved those who were close to me.</p>

        Here is the Affinity DIagram that I made by myself. In it I reviewed ideas and points 
        that I believe could be helpful when creating this project. They are Basic app features, 
        Ads and Marketing, Future Growth, Costs, and Possible Problems.

        These 3 sketches represent possible frameworks for the mobile app that I think will solve my problem. 
        I drew a sign in page, a Home page with a nav bar, and a settings page
